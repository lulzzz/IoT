# IoT
Maybe, someday it will become a .NET Core based IoT platform... or stay just an experiment with MQTT

# Content

- IoT.Device.Service: MQTT Server using MQTTnet
- IoT.TestClient: MQTT Client using M2MqttDotNetCoreClient. I used a Client Library from a differnt autor to improve testing.
- IoT.TestPublisherClient: Publisher for performance tests
- IoT.TestReceiveClient: Receiver for performance test

# Current State

Performance test were disillusioning... Therefore I will not continue with this experiment based on MQTTnet-server.
